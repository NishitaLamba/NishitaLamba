I love being a Data Scientist, and this is my story.... 📕

🖐🏻 My name is Nishita Lamba. I graduated from Columbia University in December 2020 with a master’s degree Business Analytics 👩🏻‍🎓. I am a Data scientist with almost 3 years of experience creating efficient data pipelines, analyzing data, building statistical models, and generating strategic insights 👩🏻‍💻.

I got my first job!! 💼
I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics and was looking for jobs in India. While interviewing for one of the financial institutions, the recruiter advised me to apply for the Data Scientist role at their firm instead of the one that I was being interviewed for. I applied and got promoted to the final round. The final round was with the VP of operations and he liked me. I started my career as a Junior Data Scientist at HDFC Bank Ltd.

After working there for 2 years and exploring my love for data, I was determined to pursue a master’s degree, so I applied to the most esteemed Ivy league institutions and got selected to Columbia University for a STEM oriented master’s degree. During the completion of my degree, I engaged myself in consulting projects to gain hands on experience as a Data Science consultant and a Marketing Analyst. I also interned with Mr. Jose Luis De La rosa as a Data Scientist at ProjectX.

During the past few years, I have equipped myself with a balance of technical skills and business intelligence. I also have extensive experience of working with large scale datasets in Python, SQL, R and Tableau using various Machine Learning techniques.📊📈

I have always been drawn to interesting problems and more than anything, the ability to make an impact 💯. I’m looking for the opportunity to work alongside other passionate professionals and bring both my professional and academic backgrounds to add value and help collectively tap into insights, allowing for business growth and the improvement of overall decision making.
